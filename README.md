# Mailservercheck

## General

This is a simple tool for MS-Windows that checks the connection to a given DNS-Servername with the standard E-Mail protocols(SMTP, IMAP, POP3).

## Usage

Just download the executable file and run it. You may enter your mail server into the text field and then press check to have the different ports and protocols checked automatically.

If you like to adapt the program, just take the .au3 file and download AutoIT - a freely available script compiler for windows. The executable unpacks three needed icons upon program start. Before program exit the icon files are deleted. So you do not need to download the icon files from here. Just run the script and the icon files are placed into the current directory of the executable.
